                        There are Maximum Waiting List Limits in the PRS booking system for which Waitlisted Tickets can be issued after all confirmed tickets are exhausted. Your ticket booking request may get declined as the Maximum Waiting List Limit may be reached in the booking system by the time payment success response is received from your bank. In such case, your deducted amount will be refunded back, without any deductions, to your bank account in 5-7 working days.
